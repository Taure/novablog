## Nova apps

Our idea was that we in an easy way could use someone else Nova app in your code. If someone have done an cool shell that you can access from web and want to use it in your Nova app you can include it.

First you need to add that Nova app as a dependency to your application. After that you will need to configure your `sys.config` with the details for the Nova app you want to use.
